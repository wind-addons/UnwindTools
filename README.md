## ✨ Features

UnwindTools is a utility pack I maintain outside WindTools, bringing together WeakAuras I previously shared and a few everyday tools.

### Guild Helper

Built for officers who need to process invites and cleanup fast, without manual spam.

It keeps invites and cleanup in one workflow: watch selected community channels and batch-invite players, then build a rule-based kick list and execute removals after review. The flow is designed to stay fast without losing control, so regular maintenance takes less effort while accidental removals are less likely.

### Audio Device Switcher

Made for players who frequently switch between speakers, headset, or stream setup.

It gives you two practical modes: auto mode tries to reset WoW audio back to your primary device when system devices change, while manual mode lets you define regex-based device rules and cycle through matched outputs with one button. In practice, it does more than simple switching—it also helps recover from device drift during real gameplay.
